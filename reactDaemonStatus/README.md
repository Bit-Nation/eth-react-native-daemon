# This is under heavy testing and development. Threat this repo more as a test repo where we don't follow the usual git workflow used by bitnation.

Setup & running:

1) Start local server: npm start
2) Launch project on Xcode. Be sure to change the hardcoded IP Address to your device's Address (this will be fixed soon)
3) Run from Xcode  in your device (does not run on Simulator)
