# This is under heavy testing and development. Threat this repo more as a test repo where we don't follow the usual git workflow used by bitnation.

Setup & running:

1) Start local server: npm start.
2) Launch project on Xcode using Workspace: "eth-daemon.xcworkspace", under folder "ios". Be sure to change the hardcoded IP Address to your device's Address (this will be fixed soon) in the AppDelegate.m -> didFinishLaunchingWithOptions.
3) Run from Xcode  in your device (does not run on Simulator).
