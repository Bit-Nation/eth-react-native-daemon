# This is under heavy testing and development. Threat this repo more as a test repo where we don't follow the usual git workflow used by bitnation.


This version runs on iOS Simulator, but uses an older version of the Status-IM lib (tag 0.9.6) due problems with the latest one.

Setup & running:

1) Start local server at folder's root: "npm start".
2) Launch project on Xcode opening the workspace: eth-daemon.xcworkspace.
3) Run from Xcode, setting as target: Simulator iPhone 6 or newer - You can check on the Debbuger panel all the logs
